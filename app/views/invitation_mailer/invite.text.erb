<%= @link %>


Just in case you’re wondering what you’re about to sign up for, here’s a handy description we wrote just for you (and everyone else):


You’re about to sign up for playoff fantasy football. Think of it as a cross between survivor football and fantasy football with the added intrigue of teams being eliminated during the playoffs. You have to pick a new roster each week, but once you pick a player, that’s it, you can’t use that player again. Still confused? Learn more here, http://www.oldtownsports.com/how_it_works.


Good luck and have fun!
